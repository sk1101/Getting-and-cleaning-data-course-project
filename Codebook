The new(more appropriate) variables:

The variables have been changed by using the following commands:

These commands change the variable name as such:
n<-sub('[0-9]+ ','',n) :
"1 tBodyAcc-mean()-X"  ---->  "tBodyAcc-mean()-X"
"2 tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"  ---->  "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"
"3 tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"  ---->  "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"

n<-sub('^t','(Time domain)',n) :
"tBodyAcc-mean()-X"  ---->  "(Time Domain)BodyAcc-mean()-X"
"tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"  ---->  "(Time Domain)BodyAcc-mean()-Y"
"tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"  ---->  "(Time Domain)BodyAcc-mean()-Z"

n<-sub('^f','(Frequency domain)',n) :
"fBodyAcc-mean()-X"  ---->  "(Frequency domain)BodyAcc-mean()-X"
"fBodyAcc-mean()-Y"  ---->  "(Frequency domain)BodyAcc-mean()-Y"
"fBodyAcc-mean()-Z"  ---->  "(Frequency domain)BodyAcc-mean()-Z"

n<-sub('std','standard deviation',n) :
"(Time Domain)BodyAcc-std()-X" ----> "(Time Domain)BodyAcc-standard deviation()-X"
"(Time Domain)BodyAcc-std()-Y" ----> "(Time Domain)BodyAcc-standard deviation()-Y"
"(Time Domain)BodyAcc-std()-Z" ----> "(Time Domain)BodyAcc-standard deviation()-Z"

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
